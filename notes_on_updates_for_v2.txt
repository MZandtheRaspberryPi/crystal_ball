Notes on Updates for V2
3d design
Mount the orb lower down on the cane, more stable, directly onto cane not onto ribbon. Perhaps 2/4 mounting points?
multiple mounts for the bowl so it doesn't make noise/shift around. Consider inserting into the mount with a channel for bowl and mount points by 1mm for light?
for the pcb, put hex mounts on the botton of base, screw down.

hardware
move to battery and 3.3v w/ adafruit feather. esp32.

software
button shouldn't refresh page or move away
make button text less verbose
make it easier to adjust colours
add in more modes
